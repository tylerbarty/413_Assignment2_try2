    <p>nothing quite like a hike up the virgin narrows at 6:00am ;)</p>

    <p>
        I hope to get some mad skills out of this IS 413 class so that I can build a web application that will do my homework and make me breakfast in bed <br />
        or at least tell me certain things like the weather (maybe I shouldn't get my expectations up too much
    </p>

    <p>the three top occupations I hope to get when I graduate:</p>
    <ul id="quiz-props">
        <li>Product Manager</li>
        <li>Project Manager</li>
        <li>Backend Developer</li>
    </ul>
    <br /><br /><br />
    <p>please note: I did minmal css on this page to prove that I could do css, I honestly couldn't care how it looks</p>
